<p>Sea glass is one of those small miracles people forget about. It starts as trash, something sharp and dangerous, thrown into the ocean without a thought. But after years of waves tumbling it around, it turns smooth, soft, and beautiful, a gem made by the sea. People collect it in jars or make necklaces from it, not realizing theyre holding something that was once broken. Its natures quiet way of saying, I can fix this.</p>
